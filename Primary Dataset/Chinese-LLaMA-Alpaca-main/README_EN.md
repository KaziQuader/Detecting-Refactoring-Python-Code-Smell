To promote open research of large models in the Chinese NLP community, this project has open-sourced the **Chinese LLaMA model and the Alpaca large model with instruction fine-tuning**. These models expand the Chinese vocabulary based on the original LLaMA and use Chinese data for secondary pre-training, further enhancing Chinese basic semantic understanding. Additionally, the project uses Chinese instruction data for fine-tuning on the basis of the Chinese LLaMA, significantly improving the model's understanding and execution of instructions.

## Model Download

### ‚ö†Ô∏è User Notice (Must Read)

The official [LLaMA models released by Facebook prohibit commercial use](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), and the official model weights have not been open-sourced (although there are many third-party download links available online). In order to comply with the relevant licenses, it is currently not possible to release the complete model weights. We appreciate your understanding. After Facebook fully opens up the model weights, this project will update its policies accordingly. **What is released here are the LoRA weights**, which can be seen as a "patch" for the original LLaMA model, and the complete weights can be obtained by merging the two.

### Model Overview

The following figure depicts all open-sourced models for our projects (including the [second-gen project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2)).

### Recommended Models

Below is a list of models recommended for this project. These models typically use more training data and optimized model training methods and parameters, so they should be used preferentially (for other models, please check [Other Models](#Other-Models)). **If you want to experience ChatGPT-like interaction, please use the Alpaca model instead of the LLaMA model.** For Alpaca models, please use Pro versions for longer responses. If you prefer shorter response, please use Plus series instead.

**[1]** The original LLaMA model needs to be applied for use in [Facebook-LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) or refer to this [PR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/73/files). Due to copyright issues, this project cannot provide downloads, and we ask for your understanding.

**[2]** The reconstructed model is slightly larger than the original LLaMA (due to the expanded vocabulary); the 7B model is about 13G+.

**[3]** After downloading, be sure to check whether the SHA256 of the ZIP file is consistent; for the full value, please see [SHA256.md](./SHA256.md).

**[4]** Merging steps for Alpaca-Plus are different from others, please refer to [wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/Manual-Conversion#multiple-lora-weights-merging-applicable-to-chinese-alpaca-plus).

**[5]** Also known as 30B model in elsewhere. There was a naming typo in release this model by Facebook. We stick to their original paper naming convention here (and also the actual numbers of weights).

**[6]** Stored in FP16.

The file directory inside the ZIP file is as follows (using Chinese-LLaMA as an example):

## System Performance

### Generation Performance Test

In order to quickly evaluate the actual performance of related models, this project compared the effects of Chinese Alpaca-7B, Alpaca-13B, Alpaca-Plus-7B, Alpaca-Plus-13B, and Alpaca-33B on some common tasks given the same prompt. Reply generation is random and is affected by factors such as decoding hyperparameters and random seeds. The following related evaluations are not absolutely rigorous, and the test results are for reference only. Welcome to experience it yourself. 

- For detailed evaluation results, please see [examples](./examples)
- üìä Alpaca ChatBot Arena: [http://chinese-alpaca-arena.ymcui.com](http://chinese-alpaca-arena.ymcui.com/)

### NLU Performance Test

This project also conducted tests on relevant models using the "NLU" objective evaluation dataset. The results of this type of evaluation are objective and only require the output of given labels, so they can provide insights into the capabilities of large models from another perspective. In the recently launched [C-Eval dataset](https://cevalbenchmark.com/), this project tested the performance of the relevant models. The test set contains 12.3K multiple-choice questions covering 52 subjects. The following are the evaluation results (average) of some models on the validation and test sets. For complete results, please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08177).

| Models                  | Valid (zero-shot) | Valid (5-shot) | Test (zero-shot) | Test (5-shot) |
| ----------------------- | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: |
| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-33B |       46.5        |      46.3      |       44.9       |     43.5      |
| Chinese-Alpaca-33B      |       43.3        |      42.6      |       41.6       |     40.4      |
| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-13B |       43.3        |      42.4      |       41.5       |     39.9      |
| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-7B  |       36.7        |      32.9      |       36.4       |     32.3      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-33B  |       37.4        |      40.0      |       35.7       |     38.3      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-33B       |       34.9        |      38.4      |       34.6       |     39.5      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-13B  |       27.3        |      34.0      |       27.8       |     33.3      |
| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-7B   |       27.3        |      28.3      |       26.9       |     28.4      |

It is important to note that the comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of large models is still an urgent and significant topic to address. It is beneficial to approach the various evaluation results of large models in a rational and balanced manner to promote the healthy development of large-scale model technology. It is recommended for users to conduct tests on their own tasks and choose models that are suitable for the relevant tasks.

For C-Eval inference code, please refer to >>> [üìöGitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/C-Eval-performance-and-script).

## Training Details

The entire training process includes three parts: vocabulary expansion, pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning. Please refer to [merge_tokenizers.py](scripts/merge_tokenizer/merge_tokenizers.py) for vocabulary expansion; refer to [run_clm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py) in ü§ótransformers and the relevant parts of dataset processing in the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) project for pre-training and self-instruct fine-tuning.

We have open-sourced the scripts for pre-training and instruction finetuning (SFT): 

- Pre-training: [scripts/training/run_clm_pt_with_peft.py](./scripts/training/run_clm_pt_with_peft.py), refer to [Pre-training Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/Pretraining-Script)

- Instruction Finetuning: [scripts/training/run_clm_sft_with_peft.py](./scripts/training/run_clm_sft_with_peft.py), refer to [SFT Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/SFT-Script)

## FAQ

FAQ provides answers to frequent questions. Please see our FAQ before submitting an issue.

```
Q1: Why can't you release the complete model weights?
Q2: Will there be versions of 33B, and 65B in the future?
Q3: The model doesn't perform well on some tasks!
Q4: Why expand the vocabulary? Can't you just pre-train the original LLaMA with Chinese data?
Q5: The reply is very short
Q6: Under Windows, the model cannot understand Chinese, the generation speed is very slow, etc.
Q7: Chinese-LLaMA 13B model cannot be launched with llama.cpp, reporting inconsistent dimensions.
Q8: Chinese-Alpaca-Plus does not show better performance than the others.
Q9: The model does not perform well on NLU tasks, such as text classification.
Q10: Why 33B not 30B?
Q11: Inconsistent SHA256
```

## Limitations

Although the models in this project have significantly improved Chinese understanding and generation capabilities compared to the original LLaMA and Alpaca, there are also the following limitations:

- It may produce unpredictable harmful content and content that does not conform to human preferences and values.
- Due to computing power and data issues, the training of the related models is not sufficient, and the Chinese understanding ability needs to be further improved.
- There is no online interactive demo available for now (Note: users can still deploy it locally themselves).
